vlmcsd is
a replacement for Microsoft's KMS server
It contains vlmcs, a KMS test client, mainly for debugging purposes, that also can "charge" a genuine KMS server
designed to run on an always-on or often-on device, e.g. router, NAS Box, ...
intended to help people who lost activation of their legally-owned licenses, e.g. due to a change of hardware (motherboard, CPU, ...)
vlmcsd is not
a one-click activation or crack tool
intended to activate illegal copies of software (Windows, Office, Project, Visio)

CHANGES
2020-03-28 (1113)
.kmd file format changed to version 2.0 (version 1.x files cannot be used any more)
host builds are now configurable in the .kmd file
Bugfix: vlmcs did not use the configured CSVLKs when used with -G
Bugfix: .kmd file version was not displayed correctly on big-endian systems
Bugfix: Posix versions of vlmcsd were unable to read MS-DOS/Windows text files with crlf line termination
Bugfix: the NO_INI_FILE CFLAG did not work in combination with some other directives
New CFLAG NO_COMPILER_UAA disables all compiler/platform support for big-endian/little-endian conversion. Required on some toolchains that are incorrectly configured
The bootable floppy directory now contains a .vmx file that can be used to directly start the floppy in VMware products, e.g. the free VMware player
When you use -v all CSVLK available in the .kmd file are now logged at program startup.
If you do not use -N0 or -N1 to force disable/enable the NDR64 protocol, vlmcsd now uses the host build to decide if it uses NDR64 depending if a genuine KMS is using NDR64 on that build.
